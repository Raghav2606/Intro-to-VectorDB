Understanding Escheatment: A Deep Dive
1. Introduction to Escheatment
Escheatment is the process by which unclaimed, abandoned, or inactive financial assets are transferred to a government authority—typically a state treasury or unclaimed property office—after a legally defined dormancy period. It serves as a protective legal mechanism to ensure that abandoned funds are safeguarded and can potentially be reclaimed by the rightful owners or their heirs in the future.

The word "escheat" originates from the feudal era in England, where the property of a person who died without heirs would revert ("escheat") to the crown. In modern financial systems, it refers more broadly to all unclaimed intangible or tangible assets.

2. Why Escheatment Matters
The escheatment process is essential for several reasons:

Consumer Protection: It ensures that companies cannot indefinitely retain control of unclaimed assets.

Transparency and Accountability: It imposes reporting requirements on businesses and financial institutions.

Reclamation: Provides a method for rightful owners to recover their assets from the state.

Revenue Source: While not its primary goal, escheated funds can temporarily contribute to state revenues until claimed.

3. Common Types of Escheatable Assets
Escheatment typically involves a wide variety of assets, including but not limited to:

Dormant bank accounts

Unclaimed insurance policy proceeds

Uncashed checks or payroll

Stocks and dividends

Safe deposit box contents

Gift cards (in some jurisdictions)

Customer credits or refunds

Unclaimed trust or escrow balances

4. Dormancy Period and Triggers
Each asset class has a dormancy period—a legally defined period of inactivity—after which escheatment must occur. Dormancy periods vary by:

State/region: Each state in the U.S., for example, sets its own rules.

Asset type: A checking account may become dormant after 3 years, while an insurance policy might take 5 years.

Trigger events may include:

No contact from the owner

Returned mail or undeliverable address

Inactivity in accounts (no withdrawals, deposits, or logins)

Failure to cash a check

5. Escheatment Process Overview
Identify Dormant Accounts: Financial institutions run reports to flag accounts that meet dormancy criteria.

Attempt to Contact Owner: Before escheatment, institutions must try to contact the rightful owner (due diligence).

Report to the State: If no response is received, the account or funds must be reported to the appropriate state authority.

Transfer Funds: The institution transfers the property or funds to the state.

State Custody: The state holds the funds until the owner or heir files a valid claim.

6. Due Diligence Requirements
Before escheatment, businesses are typically required by law to make reasonable efforts to contact the rightful owner. This includes:

Sending mailed notices to the last known address

Attempting email contact (in more modern systems)

Publishing notices in local newspapers (less common today)

7. State Unclaimed Property Programs
Most U.S. states have an unclaimed property website where individuals can search for and claim escheated funds. For example:

https://www.missingmoney.com — a multi-state site

Each U.S. state has its own treasury or controller site for property searches

8. Business Obligations
Businesses have the following responsibilities:

Track Dormant Assets: Monitor activity on customer accounts and assets.

Notify Owners: Perform due diligence before escheating funds.

File Reports: Submit detailed reports to each applicable jurisdiction.

Remit Funds: Send unclaimed property to the state treasury or controller.

Failure to comply can lead to:

Fines and penalties

Legal audits

Reputation risk

9. Compliance Software and Tools
To manage escheatment risk, companies often use tools or services that:

Monitor dormancy timelines

Automate customer outreach

Generate compliance reports

Handle multi-state regulations

Integrate with financial systems (e.g., ERP, CRM)

Vendors like Sovos, Kelmar, and others provide specialized escheatment compliance solutions.

10. Escheatment in Financial Services and Fintech
Escheatment is particularly important in industries like:

Banking: Dormant savings/checking accounts

Insurance: Life policies or annuities not claimed by beneficiaries

Brokerages: Inactive stock portfolios or dividends

Fintech/Wallets: Prepaid cards, gift balances, cashback rewards

Payroll & HR: Uncashed paychecks, expense reimbursements

11. Global Perspective
While escheatment is widely recognized in the U.S., other countries have similar laws:

Canada: Provincial laws govern unclaimed property

UK: Dormant Asset Scheme for financial services

Australia: Unclaimed money administered by ASIC

Terminology and handling differ, but the core idea — protecting abandoned property — remains.

12. Legal and Regulatory Framework
In the U.S., escheatment laws are governed at the state level, with models inspired by:

Uniform Unclaimed Property Act (UUPA): A guideline used by many states

Each state modifies the UUPA based on its own legislation

There is no single federal law covering escheatment, but federal agencies (like the SEC) may impose related disclosure requirements.

13. Reclaiming Escheated Property
If someone discovers they have unclaimed funds:

They search on a state or national portal.

Submit a claim with proper identification (and documentation).

State verifies the claim.

Property is returned to the rightful owner.

This process is free — beware of scams or services asking for a fee.

14. Common Pitfalls and Audit Triggers for Companies
Companies often make errors such as:

Not maintaining last contact dates

Not updating addresses

Failing to perform due diligence

Misclassifying property types

States conduct unclaimed property audits, which can go back 10–15 years.

15. Conclusion: The Role of Escheatment in Modern Finance
Escheatment is not just a legal obligation—it is a key part of ethical business operations and consumer trust. By returning unclaimed property to the state, businesses play a role in transparency, accountability, and public stewardship of assets that might otherwise be forgotten.

Whether you're an individual looking to recover funds or a business managing compliance risk, understanding escheatment helps you stay aligned with both the law and fair financial practice.
